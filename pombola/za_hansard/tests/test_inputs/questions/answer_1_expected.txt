Mr J Selfe (DA) to ask the Minister of Correctional Services:

How  many  officials  within  his  department  have  been  investigated  for
disciplinary issues  in  the  (a)  2010-11,  (b)  2011-12  and  (c)  2012-13
financial years, and,  in  each  case,  what  (i)  was  the  nature  of  the
disciplinary charge and (ii)  subsequent  action  was  taken  against  them?

       NW2470E


REPLY

The  number  of  disciplinary  hearings  recorded  in  the   Department   of
Correctional Services and the  outcomes  thereof  are  published  in  Tables
4.11.2 and 4.11.3 in the Departmentâs Annual Reports for  the  corresponding
financial years as follows:

Note: The numbers in (i) and (ii) will differ due to  some  employees  being
involved in more than  one  disciplinary  case  and/or  sometimes  facing  a
number of charges that result in  more    than  one  sanction  in  the  same
hearing.
